# SearchAThing.Sci

## Introduction

This Sci library is a work in progress.

First a short requisites design document already uploaded [SearchAThing.Sci - Requisites.docx](https://github.com/devel0/SearchAThing.Sci/blob/master/doc/SearchAThing.Sci%20-%20Requisites.docx).

Then the design of abstract classes with unit tests within the implementation.

In general this library would help to manage common aspect of sci projects such as:
- measure unit conversion and GUI, file serialization
- 2d operations (circle, poly, boolean)
- 3d operations (line, segment, plane, parallel, perp, intersect, quaternion rotation)
- coordinate system
