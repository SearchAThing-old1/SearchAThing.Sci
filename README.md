This Sci library is a work in progress.
First a short requisites design document already uploaded ( SearchAThing.Sci - Requisites.docx ).
Then the design of abstract classes with unit tests.
Finally the implementation.

In general this library would help to manage common aspect of sci projects such as:
- measure unit conversion and GUI, file serialization
- 2d operations (circle, poly, boolean)
- 3d operations (line, segment, parallel, perp, intersect, quaternion rotation)
- coordinate system
